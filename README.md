![Two-Tier Architecture](https://imgur.com/X4dGBg6.gif)

## Overview  

This project demonstrates a **Two-Tier architecture on AWS** using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It follows a modular and security-enhanced approach to create a **scalable, secure, and maintainable** infrastructure

### Key Features  

- **Modular Architecture** – Reusable Terraform modules for better management  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Automate AWS resource provisioning  
- **Security Best Practices** – IAM roles, policies, and WAF integration  
- **Scalability & High Availability** – Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, and Route 53  
- **Database Integration** – Managed Amazon RDS deployment  
- **SSL & CDN Optimization** – Secure connections and content acceleration

## Getting Started  

### Clone the Repository  

### Initialize and Apply Terraform  

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file=variables.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=variables.tfvars --auto-approve
```  

### Cleanup (Destroy Infrastructure)  

```bash
terraform destroy -var-file=variables.tfvars --auto-approve
```

## Project Architecture Highlights  

### **Networking & Security**  

**VPC & Subnets** – Securely isolated environment for your application  
**IAM & Role-Based Access Control** – Fine-grained security permissions  
**AWS WAF** – Protect against common web threats  

### **Compute & Scaling**  

**Auto Scaling Group** – Dynamic scaling based on demand  
**Application Load Balancer (ALB)** – Efficient traffic distribution  
**EC2 Instances** – Reliable computing power  

### **Storage & Database**  

**Amazon RDS** – Managed database for scalability and reliability  
**S3 Buckets** – Secure storage for application assets  

### **Networking & Optimization**  

**Amazon Route 53** – Scalable domain name system (DNS)  
**Amazon CloudFront (CDN)** – Faster content delivery worldwide  
**SSL/TLS Encryption** – Secure communication with ACM
